To become familiar with the layout of the VLIDORT 2.8.3 package and its installation tests in a fairly quick manner, the user is advised to go to Chapter 3 of the VLIDORT 2.8.3 User Guide.  In particular, information and instructions related to installing VLIDORT 2.8.3, running its package test scripts, and crosschecking the results of the tests generated by the user may be found in section 3.3.4.

To use the "Check2" facility, first type in this directory (example for gfortran)
   > gfortran -o vlidort_diff util/vlidort_diff.f90
This creates executable "vlidort_diff" which is called repeatedly by the "vlidort_check2.bash" script.
