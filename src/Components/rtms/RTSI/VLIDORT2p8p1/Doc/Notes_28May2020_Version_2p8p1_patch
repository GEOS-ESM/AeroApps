Changes to VLIDORT 2.8.1, 05 May 2020
=====================================

Debugging and Feedback have led to Several changes
All Changes marked "5/5/20. Version 2.8.1 Upgrades"

1. In subdirectory vlidort_def:

      All vlidort_pars.f90 modules (6 of them)

   ==> The MAXSTREAMS_BRDF parameter must be set to an even number (100)

2. In subdirectory vlidort_def:

      vlidort_outputs_def.f90
      vlidort_lin_outputs_def.f90

   ==> Some specialist output was added (but it remains commented out) for
       generation of Fourier components in a zero-albedo Rayleigh scenario
       goes with 3(c).

3. In subdirectory vlidort_main_FO_1p5/regular_modules

      vlidort_masters_V2p8p1.f90:

(a)  ==> Check on planetary problem conditions has been relaxed, formerly 
         Rayleigh only, now allowed for aerosols and FOCORR_NADIR. Now 2
         Error messages in the exception handling.

(b)   ==> Planetary problem output was revised to use only the first index of the 
          TRANSBEAM arrays, this makes the Q-problem valid (polarized output)

(c)   ==> Some specialist output was added (but it remains commented out) for
          generation of Fourier components in a zero-albedo Rayleigh scenario.

4. In subdirectory vlidort_main_FO_1p5/linearized_modules

      vlidort_lps_masters_V2p8p1.f90
      vlidort_lcs_masters_V2p8p1.f90

   The above three items in #3 have also been applied in the linearized masters
   with additional code to handle linearizations.

5. In subdirectory fo_main_1p5_NEW

     FO_VectorSS_RTCalcs_I.f90
     FO_VectorSS_RTCalcs_ILPS.f90
     FO_VectorSS_RTCalcs_ILCS.f90

   The Output CUMTRANS array for the water-leaving situation was not
   properly initialized - coming out with wrong values in all 3 of these
   modules (Upwelling only). LC_CUMTRANS was also not properly initialized
   but LP_CUMTRANS was OK. Now consistent.

   The test-driver results (LWCoupling) were in fact correct from the previous
   version, but this was accidental(!), due to the fact that the output is
   at 2 levels ToaUp and BoaUp, with the latter option providing the correct
   bookkeeping number NSTART just by virtue of it being NLAYERS !!!!

6. In subdirectory fo_main_1p5_NEW

      FO_DTWPgeometry_master.f90
      FO_Thermal_RTCalcs_I.f90
      FO_Thermal_RTCalcs_ILPS.f90
      FO_Thermal_RTCalcs_ILCS.f90
      VFO_Master.f90
      VFO_LinMasters.f90

   The direct thermal whole- and partial-layer calculations were incorrect
   with the FOCORR_OUTGOING option, because the thermal emission
   parameterizations were based on the SLANT optical depths rather than the
   vertical optical depths. Necessary to output the vertical height drops
   from the geometry routine, and use them to get the thermal emission
   solutions in terms of vertical optical depths.

7. A bug was found in the Vsup/vfzmat module vfzmat_Rayleigh.f90.
   Basically the Rayleigh phase function was being calculated with
   a reduced second coefficient. Once corrected,  two implementations
   in the FO code (direct use of F-matrices versus use of expansion coeffs)
   give the same answers (to 7 SF) in the FOCODE SSCORR calculation of
   intensities. The test driver for the vfzmat option was changed slightly
   so that the "direct use of F-matrices" option is in force. A new set of
   test output was generated/
   
8. The modules 

      vlidort_vfo_lcs_interface.f90
      vlidort_vfo_lps_interface.f90

   These were moved from the former location (regular_modules) to the new
   location (linearized_modules), where they really belong. The makefiles
   in the test directories were modified accordingly.

9. In vlidort_inputs.f90, CHECK_INPUT subroutine. Look for 6/17/20.

   The check on FOCORR_OUTGOING and FOCORR_NADIR, has been relaxed to allow
   the FO_CORR calculation to be performed for Plane-parallel input. Forermly
   this was not allowed, and was returning a serious error.
