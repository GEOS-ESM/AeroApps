Notes:

1. Currently mcs_aero.py is very memory intensive.
It will only run on dali, not discover.

2. Need the following resource files to run mcs_aero.py:
  Aod_MODIS_Clouds.rc
  Chem_Registry.rc
  variables.rc

3. Directory must contain a link to the aerosol mie tables data
called Extdata. For example,
  ln -s /discover/nobackup/projects/gmao/share/dasilva/fvInput/ ExtData
