.TH development
.SH NAME
future plans for Lagranto
.SH MAJOR
.TP 5
.B [1] CF netCDF [until 1 April 2011]
interface to CF netCDF format
.TP 5
.B [2] GRIB 
interface to GRIB format
.TP 5
.B [3] box tracing
Instead of tracing point meteorological fields, trace the mean,maximum, minimum, median, variance,... within a box around the trajectory position 
.TP 5
.B [4] stochastic trajectories
allow in caltra the addition of a random noise to the velocities; option "-random 0.01" would allow random variations of U, V and OMEGA in the range of 1 %. As a further step, a physical based "parameterisation" of turbulence could be included (based on Ri, DEF, TKE,...). This would allow to calculate an ensemble of trajectories, e.g. for one receptor point. 
.TP 5
.B [5] Parallelisation
parallelisation of caltra, and possibly also of trace and select.
.TP 5
.B [6] webLagranto
web interface to Lagranto - in analogy to the HYSPLIT model
.TP 5
.B [7] cosmoLagranto
new version of COSMO Lagranto
.SH MINOR
.TP 5
.SH [1] SPECIAL
remeber the settings for a SPECIAL command in the parameter list; this will make the evaluation of SPECIAL commands more efficient.
.TP 5
.SH [2] offset in K
allow vertical offsets in K for tracing, e.g. 'PV:+5K' traces PV 5 K above the trajectory position
.TP 5
.B [3] SPECIAL:STE
special criterion for STE, STT and TST in the form SPECIAL:STE:380,2,0,24,48; tropopause 2 PVU/380 K, STE within time 0-24 h, residence before and after the exchange at least 48 h.
.TP 5
.B [4] compact data format
additional formats for trajectory files: 1) compressed format; 2) FLEXPART format.
.TP 5
.B [5] Goody: residence
calculate the residence time in a specified region for all trajectories in a file
.TP 5 
.B [6] Goody: distance
calculate the mimimum distance from a lon/lat/p point for all trajectories in a file.
.TP 5
.B [6] Extension of Lagranto run
extend forward and backward in time an existing Lagranto run
.TP 5
.B [7] Definition of polygons
Matlab tool for the definition of polygon files. 
.TP 5
.B [8] datelist
Goody for handling of datelists: 1) datelist file -create start end; 2) datelist file -len; 3) datelist file -first|last; 4) datelist file -sort; 5) datelist file1 file2 -onlyin1|onlyin2|overlap|difference
