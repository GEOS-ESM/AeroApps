.SH NAME
.B trace - trace meteorological fields along trajectories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trace
.I inpfile
.I outfile
[
.I optional arguments
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Trace meteorological fields along the trajectories given in the input file 
.I inpfile
and write a new trajectory file
.I outfile
. The meteorological fields to trace are listed in a 
.I
tracing file 
(default: tracevars). Partly they can be computed "online" (see ONLINE CALCULATIONS below), normally they are availbale on the primary and secondary P and S files.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 15
.I inpfile
input trajectory file; the appendix determines the format (see
.B reformat 
for details).
.TP 15
.I  outfile
output trajectory file; the appendix determines the format (see
.B reformat 
for details).
.SH TRACING FILE
Normally the meteorological fields for tracing are listed in a file with name 
.B "tracevars". 
The name of the tracing file can be changed with the optional argument "-v" (see below). The format of the tracing file is as follows:

Shifts (optional)
.B - field:+100km[lat] 
- get field at trajectory position + 100 km shifted to north. A shift to south is obtained with field:-100km[lat].
.br
.B - field:+100km[lon] 
- get field at trajectory position + 100 km shifted to east. A shift to west is obtained with field:-100km[lon].
.br
.B - field:+2[dlat] 
- get field at trajectory position + 2 grid spacings dlat shifted to north. A shift to south is obtained with field:-2[dlat].
.br 
.B - field:+2[dlon] 
- get field at trajectory position + 2 grid spacings dlon shifted to east. A shift to west is obtained with field:-2[dlon].
.br 
.B - field:+50hPa 
- get field at trajectory position + 50 hPa shifted in vertical. A shift to lower pressures is obtained with field:-50hPa.
.br 
.B - field:+1dp 
- get field at trajectory position + 1 grid spacing DP shifted in vertical. A shift to lower pressures is obtained with field:-1dp. Note that DP is not fixed but varies with height.
.br 
.B - field:+6h 
- get field at trajectory position, but 6 h in the future. Shifts to the past are poeeible with field:-6h. In addition to hours (h), the time shift can be specified in minutes (min).

Examples
.B - TH 1. 0 S : 
trace potential temperature (TH), scale it with 1 (no scaling); it is available on the S file (no computation is needed: 0).
.br
.B - Q 1000. 0 P :
trace specific humidity (Q), scale it with 1000 to have g/kg; it is available on the P file (no computation is needed: 0).
.br
.B - RH 1. 1 * :
trace relative humidity (RH), no scaling is needed (1.); relative humidity is not available on either P or S file and must be computed (1). 
.br
.B - TH:100hPa 1. 0 S :
As in the first example, but now the potential temperature is taken 100 hPa below the air parcel position.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
.TP 15
.I -i hours
time increments (in hours) for input P and  S files. If not explicitely specified, this is determined from the P and S files i
n the current directory.
.TP 15
.I -v varfile
Change the name of the tracing file from its default value "tracevars" to "varfile".
.TP 15
.I -f field scale
Trace field (with scaling scale) along the trajectories; the computation flag and the prefix for the data file is automatically set. This options allows the quick tracing of a field, without specifying a tracing file.
.TP 15
.I -changet
flag whether the times of the P and S files should be changed or not before a calculation; the default is that the
times are 
.B not 
changed. 
.TP 15
.I -noclean
flag whether parameter and criterion files should be kept; this is particularly helpful for debugging.
.TP 15
.I -timecheck
enforce a time check for the data file  
.SH SPECIAL INTERPOLATION MODES
.TP 15
.I -nearest
Do no interpolation between grid points; just take the nearest neighbor! This option is useful, if a discrete input field is given (e.g. labels), where interpolated values are meaningless.
.TP 15
.I -circle_avg radius
calculate area-weighted average over all grid points within a circle of the specified radius [km]. e.g. -circle_avg 200; note that the tracing of fields within a circle is quite slow.
.TP 15
.I -circle_max radius
calculate maximum within a circle of a radius [km]. e.g. -circle_max 200
.TP 15
.I -circle_min radius
calculate minimum within a circle of a radius [km]. e.g. -circle_min 200
.TP 15
.I -clustering
special mode to trace strat/trop label; the labels are attributed according to the program (tropopause), which clusters the atmosphere into five distinct classes according to the definition of the tropopause: PV (2 PVU) and potential temperature (380 K). The clustering mode is a refined version of the nearest mode, where all surrounding eight grid points vote for the final value.
.SH ONLINE CALCULATIONS
If the computation flag in the tracing file is set to 1, a meteorological field is calculated based upon the already traced fields and/or based on the fields on the primary and secondary P and S files. The following fields are implemented for online calculations:
