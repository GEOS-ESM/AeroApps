!  Upgrade for Version 3.7
!  -----------------------

!  New Water-leaving code developed/tested by R. Spurr, April 2014
!  Based in part on Modified-6S code by A. Sayer.
!  Validated against Modified-6 OCEABRDF.F code, 24  April 2014.

!  Water-leaving upgrade according to the modified 6S specification
!  New code calculates transmittances into and out of ocean, using
!  usual sun-glint rough surface approximations. In addition, the
!  water-leaving term itself is now SZA-dependent (A. Sayer), and
!  there is now a correction for Whitecaps (again, from 6S)

!  This upgrade gives the  water-leaving terms some directionality,
!  but they are still azimuth-independent

!  Earlier version inputs were just Wavelength/Salinity/PigmentConc
!  This was enough for the isotropic case (Fast Option) in Version 3.6.
!  For Version 3.7, we require additional inputs, including:
!    - Wind-speed and Direction (direction was not used in earlier version) 
!    - flags to control use sunglint shadowing and foam (whitecaps) correction.

!  This water-leaving option is designed to work alongside the "NewCM" glint
!  reflectance option in the BRDF code. The glint and whitecap calculations
!  in the two supplements are the same.

!  You need to make sure that the wind input information is the same as that
!  used for the "NewCM" glint option in the BRDF supplement. Also, the Foam
!  correction applied here in the surface-leaving code should also be 
!  applied for "NewCM" glint.
