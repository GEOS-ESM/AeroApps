!  BRDF Upgrades for Version 3.7
!  -----------------------------

!  A. White-sky and Black-sky scaling options
!  ==========================================

!  WSA and BSA scaling options.
!   first introduced 14 April 2014, Revised, 17-22 April 2014
!      WSA = White-sky albedo. BSA = Black-sky albedo.

!  These options are mutually exclusive. If either is set, the BRDF code
!  will automatically perform an albedo calculation (either WS or BS) for
!  the (1,1) component of the complete 3-kernel BRDF, then normalize the
!  entire BRDF with this albedo before scaling up with the externally chosen
!  WSA or BSA (from input).

!  Additional exception handling has been introduced to make sure that
!  the spherical or planar albedos for a complete 3-kernel BRDF are in
!  the [0,1] range. Otherwise, the WSA/BSA scaling makes no sense. It is
!  still the case that some of the MODIS-tpe kernels give NEGATIVE albedos.

!  The albedo scaling process has been linearized for all existing surface
!  property Jacobians available to the BRDF linearized supplement. In
!  addition, it is also possible to derive single Jacobians of the BRDFs
!  with respect to the WS or BS albedo - this is separate from (and orthogonal
!  to) the usual kernel derivatives.

!  B. Alternative Cox-Munk Glint Reflectance
!  =========================================

!  In conjunction with new Water-leaving code developed for the SLEAVE
!  supplement, we have given the BRDF supplement a new option to 
!  return the (scalar) Cox-Munk glint reflectance, based on code originally
!  written for the 6S code.

!  Developed and tested by R. Spurr, 21-29  April 2014
!  Based in part on Modified-6S code by A. Sayer (NASA-GSFC).
!  Validated against Modified-6S OCEABRDF.F code, 24-28 April 2014.

!  The new glint option depends on Windspeed/direction, with refractive
!  indices now computed using salinity and wavelength. There is now an 
!  optional correction for (Foam) Whitecaps (Foam). These choices come from
!  the 6S formulation.

!  Need to make sure that the wind input information is the same as that
!  use for glint calculations in the SLEAVE supplement when the Glitter
!  kernels are in use. Also, the Foam correction applied here in the
!  surface-leaving code should also be applied in the SLEAVE system..

!  Choosing this new glint option bypasses the normal kernel inputs (and
!  also the WSA/BSA inputs). Instead, a single-kernel glint reflectance
!  is calculated with amplitude 1.0, based on a separate set of dedicated
!  inputs. This option does not apply for surface emission - the solar
!  sources flag must be turned on. There is only 1 Jacobian available - 
!  with respect to the windspeed. 

!  Note that the use of the facet isotropy flag is recommended for
!  multi-beam runs. This is because the wind-direction is a function of
!  the solar angle, and including this wind-direction in the glint
!  calculations for BRDF will only work if there is just one SZA. This
!  condition is checked for internally.
