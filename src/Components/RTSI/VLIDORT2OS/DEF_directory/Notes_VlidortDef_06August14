Conversion to 2.7
=================

These notes, 06 August 2014

ALL FILES :
-----------

Add lines in header referencing Version 2.7 (Release date, function)


PARS files :
------------

1. Add parameters TAYLOR_SMALL, TAYLOR_LARGE. Done 2013.
2. Add parameter  MAXSTREAMS_SCALING = 24, this is for the new
   Albedo scaling facility in the VBRDF supplement. April 2014
3. Add new BRDF index for "NewCM" (Alternative Cox-Munk BRDF). May 2014
4. Version Number character string updated to '2p7' (LEN=3)

vlidort_inputs_def.f90
----------------------

1. Special LTE Inputs from Version 2.6 have been commented out. 
   This is superseded by BBWF code introduced for version 2.7, March 2014

vlidort_lin_inputs_def.f90
--------------------------

1.  These two flags have been superseded in Version 2.7, March 2014
      LOGICAL  :: TS_DO_SURFBB_LINEARIZATION  !  REPLACED BY TS_DO_SURFACE_LBBF
      LOGICAL  :: TS_DO_LTE_LINEARIZATION     !  REPLACED BY TS_DO_ATMOS_LBBF
2.  Flag TS_DO_SIMULATION_ONLY has been moved from Fix Lin Control to Mod.

vlidort_lin_outputs_def.f90
---------------------------

1. Old LTE_ATMOSWFS output in Version 2.6 now replaced by new BBWF output
   TS_ABBWFS_JACOBIANS, TS_ABBWFS_FLUXES (atmospheric), and
   TS_SBBWFS_JACOBIANS, TS_SBBWFS_FLUXES (surface), March 2014

vlidort_work_def.f90. vlidort_lin_work_def
------------------------------------------

1. Completely new type structures for passing variables form Master to Fourier
   so that certain Setup operations (Misc/thermal/Multipliers) are done now 
   in the Master routines, rather than done for Fourier M = 0 and saved.
   This was done as preparation for the OpenMP Threadsafe implementation.
