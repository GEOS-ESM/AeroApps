A header file "mpif.h" is required to compile module mpeu.  Therefore,
if a MPI library is not installed on the current system, and one does
not really want to run a program under a message passing parallel
environment, a fake "mpif.h" file in this directory can be used to get
the compilation done.

Special care is needed for compilation.  For example, if a Fortran 90
source code is

  module m_mymod
    include "mpif.h"
  end module m_mymod

Its compilation command lines should look like this.

	f90 -I. -I/usr/local/mpich/include -I./jic

Note "/usr/local/mpich/include" is where the system "mpif.h" is expected
to be.  If this directory does not exist, or "mpif.h" does not exist in
this directory, the compiler will look for "mpif.h" in the next
directory "./jic".

This removed the earlier less implicit solution of the use of a special
target "mpif.h: $(LOCAL_mpif_H)" through "make all LOCAL_mpif_H=mpif.h".
