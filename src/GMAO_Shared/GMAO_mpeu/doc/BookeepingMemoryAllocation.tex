activity, generating word count output, searching/inserting a name in a list,
initializing the module data structure, etc.

EXAMPLE:

    . call mall_ci(size(marg),thread)
           is used to check-in the allocated activity.
           "thread" is a chain of characters, and
           "marg" can be an integer, a real, a logical, or a character.

    . call mall_co(size(marg),thread)
           is used to check-in the allocated activity.
