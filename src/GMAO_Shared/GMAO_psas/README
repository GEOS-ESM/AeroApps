The PSAS source (psas.tar.Z) was copied from 

	/production/psas/15may96/olde/psas-20nov96.tar.Z

The PSAS library (libpsas.a) was copied from

	/production/psas/15may96/olde/libpsas-20nov96.a

These were the versions that were used in the GEOS 2 validation
runs (etest14, pfgV_s87 and pfgV_s88).

The file psasrc.h was extracted from psas.tar.Z using the 
following:

	gtar --uncompress -x -v -f psas.tar.Z psasrc.h

It is needed to compile routine rm_bias.f in ../plug.

Revision History:

  22 Aug, 97 - Jing Guo - Commiting psas-03jul97(v1.2).
	See CRS ANA/27.  It should be tagged as psas-v1_2

  22 Aug, 97 - Jing Guo - Commiting psas-05aug97(v1.2.1).
	See CRS ANA/27.  It should be tagged as psas-v1_2_1

  22 Aug, 97 - Jing Guo - Commiting psas-12aug97(v1.2.2).
	See CRS ANA/30.  It should be tagged as psas-v1_2_2
	This version has been configured to build with f77()
	compilers.

  13 Feb, 98 - R. Todling - Commiting psas1.3.1, f90 optimized
         version that runs on the SGI (fortran v7.2)

  13 Feb, 98 - R. Todling - Commiting psas1.3.2, after bug fix

  06 Aug, 98 - R. Todling - made I90_gstr public in m_inpak90

  08 Oct, 98 - R. Todling - changes for DAO-TOVS:
                              - kxmax.h changed as by G.Brin
  07 Dec, 98 - J. Larson - Cache Optimization

  18 Dec, 98 - Jing Guo	-  Merged with a version with
	+ minor bug fixes
	+ psas library/module support for development
	+ FORTRAN i90 routine interface support

  20 Dec, 98 - Jing Guo	-  Built on three platforms, OSF1, IRIX,
	and IRIX64.

  20 Dec, 98 - Jing Guo - Removed Makefile.conf.molotov and -.-.mintz.
	They should the same as -.-.OSF1 and -.-.UNICOS respectively.
	Removing them will simplify the support.  (A bug introduced 
	in version 1-3-6d has been found in -.-.molotov)

  21 Dec, 98 - Jing Guo - For consistency, added DEFS=-DLOOP_BLOCKING
	in Makefile.conf.UNICOS

  28 Dec 1998 - Guang Ping Lou - Changed two programs that deals with
        mass-wind and decoupled winds. The two programs are:
        imat_alpha.F90 and imat_sigW.F90.

  30 Dec, 98 - Jing Guo -
	+ New versions of multitasked rec_Cxpy() and sym_Cxpy().
	+ Additional modules with advanced data types to be included
	  in the future MPI and Observation operator codes
	+ New versions of Cprod1(), Cprodx(),and gCprodx() with a
	  different memory layout for the output arrays.

  27 Jan, 99 - Jing Guo -
	+ New algorithms of determine the fcst.err.stdv., that
	  separated the grid definition of the fcst.err.stdv. data
	  file from the grid definition of the analysis (increment)
	  grid.
	+ Some refinement of modular definition of the cache/multitask
	  optimizations.
	+ Removed many and added many files.

  01 Feb, 99 - Jing Guo -
	+ A fix in Makefile.  The bug was a macro name $(_DS) mistyped
	  as $(DS).  It resulted involking wrong LAPACK routines.
	  Another example of last-minute changes may be harmful. 
	  Another example of how useful a generic interface module
	  could be.

  01 Feb, 99 - Jay Larson -
	+ Addition of code to getAIall() for calculation of the chi-
	  squared statistic.

  03 Feb, 99 - Jing Guo -
	+ Fixed a zeit-leak in getAIall() that has caused unbalanced
	  zeit-calls.
	+ Turned off pzeitpri() call from getAIall() to provent its
	  attempt to balance zeit-calls in the middle of a run.

  03 Feb, 99 - Jing Guo -
	+ Fixed the missing "share(n_j)" in mt_rec_Cxpy()/rec_Cxpy.F90
	  and the missing "share(nb_mA)" in mt_sym_Cxpy()/sym_Cxpy.F90
	  bugs found by Jay Larson.
